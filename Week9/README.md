# Week 9 - Intro 3D

## Homework

- **Read the ["Generating Meshes from Image"](http://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/generativemesh.html)** chapter of ofBook
    - this will introduce you to both 3D meshes and image sampling
    - we'll review meshes, and image sampling in class Thursday Nov 2

- **Fix up your midterm project** if it needed improvement, or if you want to continue working on it.

- If you are satisfied with your midterm as is, work on a 3D sketch instead:
    - rework an old project from your homework repo into a 3D scene


## Example Projects

- **3DBasics** - shows how to construct and draw a simple triangle mesh
- **SlitScan** - shows how to sample from the webcam to make [slit scan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSesvu_uqLo) photos
- **Waver** - 3D mesh grid, displaying image, with lighting and cameras
