# Week 6

## Homework

### Sketches

1. **Interstellar**

    Create a "space" scene, taking inspiration from the orbital motion of galaxies, stars, planets, moons, comets, asteroids... (... and black holes? :sweat_smile:)  Get creative, and don't feel limited by duplicating the _actual_ laws of physics.  You can modify physics to suit your ideas!
      
    Your objects (e.g. your stars, planets, or asteroids, etc.) should be instances of classes that you design.  They should use **forces** like **_attraction_** and **_repulsion_** (or design your own forces).
    
    Now make it interactive! :innocent:
    
    **Bonus:** Game-ify it!  Think about classic space shooters, like [Asteroids](https://www.kevs3d.co.uk/dev/asteroids/index-debug.html)...

2. **Firework Display** 

    Using **particle systems**, create a sketch that makes colorful firework-like explosions.  The "explosions" should be composed of **_particles_** that _decay_ over time (and probably are affected by gravity, or other forces)...
    
    **Bonus:** Make an interactive firework *launcher* (for example, angle and force of launch is controlled by mouse - think *Angry Birds*...)
    
### Reading

**The Nature of Code**

- **[The Nature of Code: Chapter 2 Section 9 "Gravitaional Attraction"](http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-2-forces/#chapter02_section9)**

- **[The Nature of Code: Chapter 4 "Particle Systems"](http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-4-particle-systems/)**

    Remember that **The Nature of Code** is written in the Processing language (Java), but the concepts of physics-based animation are easily translated to C++/oF.
    
**Extra:**  

- Check out **Lewis Lepton's openFrameworks YouTube series**.  It is designed for beginners, but covers some concepts we haven't yet seen, like _ofxAddons_, video, sound, and GUI controls.

    **[Here's the first episode on creating a GUI using ofxGUI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_is1x8iVtw&list=PL4neAtv21WOmrV8z9rSzL20QpdLU1zJLr&index=20)**

    (Note that the older episodes are ~2 years old, so some things like oF Project Generator will look a little different, but the principles are still relevant)
    
## Example Code && Class Review

Coming soon! Check back on Saturday morning 10/7.
